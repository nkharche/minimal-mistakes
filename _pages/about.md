I am a Data Scientist at [Earnin](https://www.earnin.com/). Prior to transitioning to Data Science, I was a researcher in theoretical and computational materials science. In my PhD and Postdoctoral research I used computer simulations and quantum mechanics to understand atomic scale phenomena in nanomaterials. My passion and broader interests are in the area of Data Science and Machine Learning. A few examples of my projects can be found on my Data Science page.
